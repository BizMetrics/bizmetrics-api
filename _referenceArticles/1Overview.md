# NOTE:

*The API is currently on a BETA and *DRAFT* state, meaning that it might still change. Nothing should be implemented until the *DRAFT* state is revoked.*

# Overview:

The API basicly consists of a REST API, where JSON content is transmitted in the body of the requests.

This API was built using the [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) spec, therefore you can use Swagger's code generating capabilites to generate a basic client that can be used with this API.

For more info on how, please consult [Swagger Codegen's project](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen). Do note that when this API gets past it's current DRAFT state, we will make available the generated code from the current spec and it will be listed here.
