# Introduction

This website contains documentation of [BizMetrics'](https://www.bizmetrics.io) API.

Detailed documentation can be found in the [Reference Documentation](/reference) section.

If you want to use the API, register [here](https://www.bizmetrics.io/#subscribe) and send an email to info@bizmetrics.io 

## Libraries

Currently there are no available libraries. The API has been built using [swagger](http://swagger.io/) which should make the generation of the client libraries easier to accomplish. Any new libraries that will become available will be posted here. If you wish to have the Swagger spec available to you to enable you to build your own client, feel free to request such access by sending an email to info@bizmetrics.io

## Note: 

The API is currently on a BETA and *DRAFT* state, meaning that it might still change. Nothing should be implemented until the *DRAFT* status is revoked.
