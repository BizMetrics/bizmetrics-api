# Introduction

This website contains documentation of [BizMetrics'](https://www.bizmetrics.io) API.

## Libraries

All of the libraries can be found on [BizMetrics' GitHub page](https://github.com/BizMetrics). And are also listed here:

 * [api-client-java](https://github.com/BizMetrics/api-client-java) - A complete and working Java library;
 * [api-client-csharp](https://github.com/BizMetrics/api-client-csharp) - The output of [Swagger's](http://swagger.io/) 1.2 code generation tool.
 * [api-client-python](https://github.com/BizMetrics/api-client-python) - The output of [Swagger's](http://swagger.io/) 1.2 code generation tool.
 
Note: The API has been built using [Swagger](http://swagger.io/), v1.2, which should make the generation of the client libraries in other languages an easier task to accomplish. If the generated source files aren't already available at [BizMetrics' GitHub page](https://github.com/BizMetrics) and in case you need help/assistance on doing so, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/BizMetrics/bizmetrics.github.io/issues) and we should provide them quickly. In case you want to do it yourself, please refer to [this documentation](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/v2.0.18).
